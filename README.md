# SmallPillsOfQt

It intends to be a repository where I'll upload small Qt and C++ projects with tips and tricks for problems I encountered during my coding life.

- DragDropCustomWidgets: Project that allows the user to drag an item from a QListWidget into a QFrame, or by extension into whatever widget is wanted. This project isn't planned for Qt Views such as QListView, QTableView... For that Qt objects there will be another different project.
- CustomWindow: Project that creates a customizable window where you can decide which buttons and window decoration you want.
